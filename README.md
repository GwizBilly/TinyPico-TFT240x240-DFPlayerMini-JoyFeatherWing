# TinPico-TFT240x240-DplayerMp3-JoyFeatherWing
Esp32 with TFT display, MP3 player module and gamepad input (joystick + buttons).
Using freeRTOS.
I added a few extra buttons to both the esp32 and the DFPlayerMini.
I also added a Serpente board with circuitPython to control the backlight when esp32 is on sleep mode.
I plan to add some buttons to control the Serpente board too... Maybe.
